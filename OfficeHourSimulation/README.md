This program is a simulation of a college professor's office hour. It runs through students asking the professor questions about certain topics and then sorts them. It also allows for the user to search which students asked certain topics and how many times each students came to the office hour. The information is outputted into three different txt files that hold different types of data. The three txt files are :topics.txt, sorted.txt, and search.txt. topics.txt provides a professor's report of all the topics asked at each office hour. sorted.txt sorts the students by the amount of times they came to the office hour. search.txt provides information on an indidual student and an specfic topic. For the individual student, it reports the the number of times a student came to office hours and which topics they asked about. For the specfic topic, it reports everytime the topic was asked about and by which student it was asked. The txt files provided contain a previously ran simulation of the office hour. The simulation test function runs the simulation 100 times.  This was a big project for my data structures class and the simulation uses many different structures.
