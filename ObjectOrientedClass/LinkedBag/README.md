This file contains a class for a linked bag. The bag.cpp, bag.h, node.cpp, and node.h files were written as part of other homework assignemnts and in class with our professor. The lbag.cpp and lbag.h was started in class with our professor and then finished by me as an assignment. The class uses linked lists to turn the bag class into a linked bag. The bag itself contains a group of items, whether it be integers, characters, or an object. The class is templated so that it is versatile in what can be stored in the bag. The both the bag class and lbag class also have custom made iterators.
