This folder contains a class I wrote for my ObjectOriented Programing Course. The class is for a bag of skittles to simulate an actual bag of skittles. 
The skittlesbag.h and skittlesbag.cpp were written fully by me. The skittlesdish.h and skittlesdish.cpp were written by my professor during class as a precursor to this project.
They are necessary for skittlesbag.h and skittlesbag.cpp to run properly which is why I included them.
